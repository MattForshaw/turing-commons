# Activity 1: Exploring Historical Case Studies
###### tags: `RRI Course (Nov 2021)`

**Questions for Reflection**

1. Which properties of these case studies do you think make them examples of unethical or (ir)responsible research and innovation?
2. Are any of these properties necessary or sufficient for categorising a research or innovation project as unethical?
3. Can you think of any other famous cases of (ir)responsible research or innovation?
4. What about cases of responsible research and innovation?
5. What properties differentiate the (ir)responsible cases from the responsible cases of research or innovation?

## Group 1

### Question 1

#### Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment
- Consent and the degree of consent from fully informed position. This leads also to the potential uses of the data, implications and possibility of predictions which may be biased or prejudiced. Borderline breach of fundamental human rights. 
- Focus on people of a certain heritage may also amount to stereotyping.
- Was there a body/framework at the time of the study? What about medical guidelines/practices? What about diversity in scientific body?
- Continued study without funding.
- Lack of transparency/explainability to participants
- Study incentives of 'free health care' - but not delivered on. Failed to provide treatment event though it was available, leading to rights breach and ultimately deaths. 
- Who was accountable? What about compensation? Especially considering lack of funding.

### Question 2

#### Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment
- Multiple unethical properties:
    - Lack of consent
    - Inscentive + not delivering on it + lack of compensation
    - Lack of transparancy/explability
    - Biases - participant selection.
    - Lack of organsistaion around study (governing bodies, following medical practices)
- Definitely. Research which breaches existing legislations is unethical from the beginning.

### Question 3

- Predictive algorithm for sentencing in USA and supposedly criminal justice. Facial recognition as well.

### Question 4

- Depends on degree of participation and opening up science.

### Question 5

Multidiciplinarities, participation

## Group 2

### Which properties?

- People who are affected most not in positions of power
- Consent 
- Power imbalance
- Transparency (lack thereof)
- At what point does research responsibility end (if it does)? How much do you need to be involved post-dissemination? (interesting idea of a pre-mortem for a research study)
- Safeguarding not in place/no effective oversight 

### Question 2

- Informed Consent
    - Example: Misleading subjects with digital infrastructure but becoming tools of research (Global South)
- Whose voice matter/who decides what is responsible? Issues of inequity 
    - Lack of a shared/agreed upon framework
    - Only one group in power defining ethics
- Negative impact to research subjects involved, and their community (insufficient just to look at niddividduaals directly involved)
- Transparency 
    - Why is the research being run? Who has funded it?

### Question 3

- Henrietta Lacks - first of its kind - immortal cell lines HeLa created - cells taken without consent from a Black woman, and then name published , and genome published (1951).No acknoledgement for a very long time.
- UK examination algorithms which discrminated against pupils based on socio-economic backgrounds 
- US: repeat offender prediction (Propublica)
- Facial recognition (biased against women and POC)
- Vipeholm - giving excessive amounts of sweets to patients in a mental health hospital to research dental care

### Question 4

- Research decisions/ethics must be opened up to Stakeholders 
- Example: Beta Blocks (City of Boston + Emerson College)
    - https://www.boston.gov/departments/new-urban-mechanics/beta-blocks
    - https://betablocks.city/

### Question 5

- Write here

## Group 3

### Question 1

- Lack of informed consent
- Opacity of purpose
- No awareness of being a data subject
- Oppression against minority populations
- No right to recourse
- Conflict of interest with funding source

### Question 2

- Qualities in combination: If there is no awareness of what you are participating in, what the purpose is or what the data is for, there is no way to make an informed decision about consent
- Research design: Lack of transparency about motivation for the research.
- Neutral third party approval of ethics and appropriate safeguarding.

### Question 3

- Stanford Prison experiment
- Phrenology
- Facebook chatbot
- Google's object detection engine - Joy Buolamwini
- Labelling of IBMs FR database
- Amazon hiring algorithm
- Milgram experiment
- Twins development study
- Wakefield vaccine autism study

### Question 4

- Predicting poaching activity
- Most (!) research is responsible, it just doesn't make the news

### Question 5

- Governance and peer review
- Transparency of study design
- Human-in-the-loop decision making
- Team and subject diversity
- Adhering to requirements throughout project lifecycle
