# # Generating a Synthetic Healthcare Dataset
# 
# This notebook will go through the steps of creating a very simplistic (and therefore unrealistic!) model to generate a synthetic dataset, where each row represents a simulated "person", for illustrative purposes.
# The dataset is used in [Chapter 4](../index.md) when discussing the '[Data Analysis](data_analysis.ipynb)' stage of the project lifecycle.
# 
# While several sophisticated and powerful tools (e.g. numpyro, Stan) exist for creating models in Python, here we will try to do something simple and understandable using nothing more than `pandas`, and the built-in `random` library.
#

import datetime
import uuid
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')


# ## NHS ID
# 
# This one is easy - we'll just make up a unique string using the "uuid" library.   The first 8 characters of the string will be more than enough to essentially guarantee uniqueness among tens of thousands of rows.

# In[2]:


def get_nhs_id():
    return str(uuid.uuid4())[:8]


# ## Generating Age and Gender
# 
# One of the main inputs we will use for our generative model is some data on the age profiles of Covid cases and deaths in the UK, taken from this [Public Health England report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-review-of-disparities-in-risks-and-outcomes)
# 
# The data is in Open Document (ods) format - we need to install the `odfpy` package to read it in into pandas in the same way as we would an Excel document.
# 
# 

# In[3]:


get_ipython().system('pip install odfpy')


# The document contains a couple of useful sheets - Figure_1_1 has the age/sex pyramid of lab-confirmed COVID cases, while Figure_1_4 has the equivalent table for deaths following a positive COVID test - we may use this second one later on.

# remove the first two rows, dealing with <20 year olds
df_cases_age_sex.drop([0,1], inplace=True)
df_cases_age_sex


# We can just sum the "Males" and "Females" columns to get the total number of each gender and calculate the probability of our simulated person being female, then just generate a random number and compare to that probability.

    prob_female = df["Females"].sum()/(df["Males"].sum()+df["Females"].sum())
    if random.random() < prob_female:
        return "F"
    else:
        return "M"


# To generate an age from an age-profile distribution, we can use a trick - by calculating the cumulative fraction over the rows, we can then generate a random number between 0 and 1, and see which row that number falls in, to give us a 10-year age range.  We then pick a random year from that range.

    x = random.random()
    # Highly inefficient way of finding which row of the dataframe
    # has that x value in the cumulative sum range.
    for i in range(len(df)):
        if i == 0 and x < df.iloc[i][column_name]:
            break
        elif x > df.iloc[i-1][column_name] and x < df.iloc[i][column_name]:
            break
    # Now we know the row number "i" - pick an age from that 10-yr range
    #    we have the "age_range" label as a string, e.g. "0-9" - first
    #    split on the dash to get lower and upper bounds
    age_range = df.iloc[i]["Age group"]
    # deal with a couple of special cases
    if age_range == "<10":
        age_range = "0-9"
    elif age_range == "80+":
        age_range="80-89"
    age_range = age_range.split("-")
    # Now use "randint" to choose an age (note that lower and upper bounds
    # are inclusive here)
    age = random.randint(int(age_range[0]), int(age_range[1]))
    return age
    


# Let's just check that these functions are doing something sensible - generate 1000 ages and plot them as a histogram:

# In[8]:


ages = {"M": [], "F":[]}
for _ in range(1000):
    sex = get_sex(df_cases_age_sex)
    ages[sex].append(get_age(df_cases_age_sex, sex))

plt.hist(ages["F"],bins=10,range=(0,100), alpha=0.5, label="F")


# OK, that looks reasonable.  We see the (surprising?) feature that women in their 60s and 70s are less likely than women in their 50s (or men in their 60s and 70s) to be diagnosed with Covid - checking back on the original DataFrame, we see that this is reflected in the numbers.
# 
# Let's move on.
# 

# ## Generating ethnicity
# 
# We will use exactly the same approach to generate the ethnicity of our simulated people, using data from the same [Public Health England report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-review-of-disparities-in-risks-and-outcomes).
# Again, we read tables from an .ods file into pandas

# In[9]:


df_ethnicity = pd.read_excel("https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/906922/Section_4_-_Ethnicity.ods",
                             sheet_name="Figure_4_1",engine="odf",skiprows=list(range(4))+[55,56])
df_ethnicity.head()


# *Note* the column here is _incorrectly_ labelled as "deaths", however, it does in fact refer to cases.
# Here we have a bit more work to do.  For the moment, we don't care about the date, so we just want to sum over all dates for each ethnic group.
# 
# Again, we also calculate the cumulative sum, which will allow us to generate the ethnicity of a simulated patient from this distribution.

# In[10]:


df_ethnicity_summary=df_ethnicity.groupby(["Ethnicity"])["Deaths"].sum().to_frame(name = 'sum').reset_index()
# calculate the cumulative sum again
df_ethnicity_summary["cumulative_frac"] = df_ethnicity_summary["sum"].cumsum()/df_ethnicity_summary["sum"].sum()
df_ethnicity_summary


# We can now write a function to generate an ethnicity, using the same trick as above with the cumulative fraction:

# In[11]:


def get_ethnicity(df):
    x = random.random()
    for i in range(len(df)):
        if i == 0 and x < df.iloc[i]["cumulative_frac"]:
            break
        elif x > df.iloc[i-1]["cumulative_frac"] and x < df.iloc[i]["cumulative_frac"]:
            break
    return df.iloc[i]["Ethnicity"]    


# ## Week of Admission
# 
# There is a table on hospital admission rates for different regions of the country on the PHE document.  We will read this table, but just sum over all regions, and yet again, calculate the cumulative fraction as we go.

# In[12]:


df_hospital_admissions = pd.read_excel("https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/906920/Section_2_-_Geography.ods",

df_hospital_admissions["sum"] = df_hospital_admissions.sum(axis=1)
df_hospital_admissions["cumulative_frac"] = df_hospital_admissions["sum"].cumsum()/df_hospital_admissions["sum"].sum()
df_hospital_admissions.head()


# In[13]:


def get_admission_date(df):
    x = random.random()
    for i in range(len(df)):
        if i == 0 and x < df.iloc[i]["cumulative_frac"]:
            break
        elif x > df.iloc[i-1]["cumulative_frac"] and x < df.iloc[i]["cumulative_frac"]:
            break
    return df.iloc[i]["Date"].to_pydatetime()


# ## Probability of admission, and of invasive ventilation
# 
# We will use yet another table from the PHE report to get the probability of being admitted to hospital, and of getting critical care (here simplified to saying "received invasive ventilation"), as a function of ethnicity.  We also make a correction to the latter probability, based on date of admission - at some point, as medical staff learned more, ventilation became less likely.

# In[14]:


df_hospital_care = pd.read_excel("https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/906922/Section_4_-_Ethnicity.ods",
                                 sheet_name="Figure_4_3",engine="odf",skiprows=list(range(5))+list(range(12,25)))
df_hospital_care


# Here, we want to convert the percentages into absolute numbers, so we can combine with `df_ethnicity_summary` to get the probability of being admitted (sum of both "Lower level of care" and "Critical care"), and of being put on ventilation ("Critical care")

# In[15]:


df_hospital_care["num_lower"] = (df_hospital_care["Lower level of care (%)"]/100) * df_hospital_care.loc[5]["Lower level of care (%)"]
df_hospital_care["num_critical"] = (df_hospital_care["Critical care (%)"]/100) * df_hospital_care.loc[5]["Critical care (%)"]
df_hospital_care["num_admitted"] = (df_hospital_care["num_lower"] + df_hospital_care["num_critical"]).astype(int)
# Get rid of the "Total admitted" row of this dataframe
df_hospital_care = df_hospital_care.drop(5)
df_hospital_care


# So let's:
# * Merge with the "df_ethnicity_summary" dataframe on "Ethnicity"
# * Add new columns for "prob admitted" and "prob ventilation"
# 
# Note that there are some mismatches in the "ethnicity" names - we should rename "Any other ethnic group" in df_ethnicity_summary to "Other ethnic groups", and also fix capitalisation on "Mixed / Multiple ethnic groups"

# In[16]:


# fix name mismatches
df_ethnicity_summary.replace(to_replace="Any other ethnic group", value="Other ethnic groups", inplace=True)
df_ethnicity_summary.replace(to_replace="Mixed / Multiple Ethnic Groups", value="Mixed / Multiple ethnic groups", inplace=True)
# harmonize column names
df_hospital_care.rename(columns={"Ethnic group":"Ethnicity"},inplace=True)
# merge dataframes
df_hospital_care = df_hospital_care.merge(df_ethnicity_summary, on="Ethnicity")
# add columns
df_hospital_care["prob_admitted"] = df_hospital_care["num_admitted"]/df_hospital_care["sum"]

# ## Generating other variables
# 

# For height and weight, we will assume Gaussian distributions of height and BMI (BMI is height (in m) divided by weight (in kg) squared), with sex-dependent means and standard deviations.
# The mean and standard deviations in height are taken from ["restore", here](https://www.restore.ac.uk/srme/www/fac/soc/wie/research-new/srme/modules/mod1/8/index.html) while those for BMI are estimates based on the values provided by [statistica, here](https://www.statista.com/statistics/375886/adult-s-body-mass-index-by-gender-and-age-in-england/).
# 
# We then do some purely ad-hoc corrections to these values to account for age.  We estimate that babies are about 0.5m tall on average, with average BMI of 23.
# For height, we assume a linear relation between average height and age from the ages 0-16, then flat afterwards, while for BMI we assume a two-sided linear relation between BMI and age, with the maximum value at age 60.
# 
# These assumptions and guesses give us means and standard deviations for Gaussians, depending on age and sex.  We can then use `random.gauss` to draw from these Gaussians and get a height and BMI for a simulated person, then use these to calculate weight.

# In[18]:


def get_height_weight(age, sex):

# ## Survival rate
# 
# Now we come to the most critical part, and also the one where we are making the most assumptions - the chance for a simulated patient who has a positive COVID test to die.
# We will start from a small baseline probability, and increase this based on several factors:
# * Age - the chance of dying from COVID increases almost exponentially with age.  Based on CDC figures [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-age.html) we estimate that using 20-year-olds as the baseline, the chances of dying with COVID approximately double for every 8 years older.
# * BMI - having a BMI over 30 increases the chance of dying
# * Sex - Men have a higher chance of dying of COVID than women
# * Ethnicity - People of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, Other Asian, Black Caribbean and Other Black ethnicity had between 10 and 50% higher risk of death when compared to White British - the numbers used here are based on table A1 in [the PHE document](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/908434/Disparities_in_the_risk_and_outcomes_of_COVID_August_2020_update.pdf)
# * We also make some ad-hoc assumptions regarding whether the patient was hospitalised and had intrusive ventilation.   In general we assume that the most seriously ill patients were admitted, and given critical care, and these were most likely to die.  
# - For those that were admitted, we apply a small correction to account for the fact that the knowledge in hospitals improved over time - we say 1% relative per day after 15th April
