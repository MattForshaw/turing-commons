## Recommending Courses

You work for an EdTech company and need to develop a recommender system that will be sold to schools to augment careers advice for students considering university courses. The system will ask each student to answer a series of questions, and will then provide an ordered list of recommended courses (linked to the respective university) that it "believes" are good options for the student. The system will also use satisfaction survey results and obtained degree results from those students who used the system previously as a way of calibrating and adjusting its recommendations (i.e., learning).
