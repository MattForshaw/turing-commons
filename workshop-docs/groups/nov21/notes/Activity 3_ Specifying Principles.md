## Group 1

### Sustainability :construction:

:::success
**Principle**

- Features: Reliable, long-term, effective resource management 
- Technical: Dockerised, Preservation of Analysis, Data and Code Backup, Open Sourced
- Quantitative Measure: 5 years, 50 years?
- How: Transfer of Knowledge, Documentation, Video Tutorials
- Interoperability, reproducibility,longevity

Sentence: A sustainability principle should focus on reliability, specifically through establishment of interoperability and reproducibility, in addition to focus on longevity. 

:::

### Accountability :gear:

:::success
**Principle**

- Features: Answerable to line manager, head of dept, CEO, citizens? Taking responsibility for actions performed, transparency, diplomatic disclosure? Setting expectations and fulfilling them? obligation to share the goals, the processes and the outcomes? Good customer support, Professional Regulatory Body specific to a subject (medicine, law)
- Technical: for ML it requires more interpretable, reproducible and explainable methods, continous testing of software applications, reliable infrastructure
- Quantitative Measure: how do you define degree of accountability? Weekly reports inside a company, Annual Reports for public and investors? Social Media Marketing to gain consumer or customer trust? Adhering to the code of ethics in the specific field 
- How: Executive Summary, Technical Summary, A way for end-users to verify the results of the software/ML application/service 
:::
Sentence: A process of clear mechanisms answerability and ascribe liability.

### Fairness :scales: 

:::success
**Principle**

- Features: Equality or Equitable? Preventing algorithmic bias and human associated bias 
- Technical: Removing bias from datasets, making ML models more robust to outiers, most ML models are designed to find patterns (benefits the majority), Preventing implied variables to creep into the dataset( house address giving away ethnicity or annual income)
- Quantitative: Lack of international standards on fairness, 
- How: Reporting the results of the application on both majority and minority people, people of different genders, Communicating how fairness was integrated into the system/service, Communicating the implications of an unfair service so that human in the loop can be integrated 
:::Sentence: A means of protecting and individuals from harmful outcomes.

## Group 2

### Sustainability :construction:

:::success
**Principle**

- This could encompass different definitions and approaches 
    - Environmental : There needs to be an understanding of the impact of machine learning/ AI
    - Technical: Code that is robust, and can be re-used ( in effect has an environmental impact as well). Long term , secure (examples from cybersecuirity)
    - Social: ???
:::

### Accountability :gear:

:::success
**Principle**

- Integration of technology in public policy in a transparent, responsible manner. Aspects to consider:
    - Transparency of process - justification for choices made (linked to Explainability)
    - Not just retroactive - procedural approach that allows a follow through the lifecycle of a project. 
    - Confidentiality - where total transparency may not be possible, there is still a mechanism in place to follow the lifecycle / provide appropriate information
    - Outlining who you are accountable to / who is going to be assessing?
:::

### Fairness :scales: 

:::success
**Principle**

- Decisions based on algorithms are fair and non-discriminatory
    - Should not exclude any particular group - perspective of all actors in the process will be valued and reflected.
    - Proactively work on discriminatory bias mitigation and equal outcomes for affected groups.
    - Validating and testing vs equality and social justice principles - internal and external
    - Risk assessment that is undertaken by all the stakeholders in a project's lifecycle to take into account the different groups affected by the project. 
    
:::

### Explainability :speaking_head_in_silhouette: 

:::success
**Principle**

- Explainability....
    - Tackling the 'black-box' assumption of AI - putting methodologies in place to make data explainable.
    - Justification for the outcome reached based on the process that was followed.
    - Access to information by all stakeholders- (e.g. open source) in an easy to digest, meaningful format.
    - Converting technical jargon into plain English to make sure it is understandable to the general audience. 
:::

### Data Quality, Integrity, Protection and Privacy :bar_chart:

:::success
**Principle**

- Factors to consider
    - The first step to consider is the Quality of data: Accuracy of data, completeness of data; is it representative of the population? ( a rotten tree yields a rotten fruit)
    - The next step to consider is to do with integrity- How the data was collected (consent)? How was it aggregated? Who has access and control of the data - important to define the roles (need to know defition)
    - Protection : Really considereing the impact of the loss of data - who will it impact?

## Group 3

### Sustainability :construction:

:::success
**Principle**

- Algorithmic systems need to be designed with a view to the long term consequences of their implementation across a range of values including social, financial and environmental impacts.
:::

### Accountability :gear:

:::success
**Principle**

- Algorithmic systems need to be designed with audit functions for the various project components and mechanisms for ascribing responsibility for outcomes.
:::

### Fairness :scales: 

:::success
**Principle**

- Algorithmic systems need to be designed with consideration and participation for a diverse range of stakeholders, with a view to social equity and non-discrimination, specifying best practice metrics for evaluating outcomes to the best of the designers knowledge.
- Algorithmic systems must not exacerbate existing prejudices or create additional discriminatory effects.
- Additional work is required to create and support access into decision making processes.
- We would like to add more specific language around perpetuating discrimination and ensuring that equity is socially embedded.
:::

### Explainability :speaking_head_in_silhouette: 

:::success
**Principle**

- Algorithmic systems need to be designed according to the principle of "understandable-by-design", empowering stakeholders to give feedback and access recourse mechanisms on decisions made.
- "understandable-by-design" Transparency, access and inclusion
- There is no explainability metric that should supercede the taget audience feeling like they understand.
:::

### Data Quality, Integrity, Protection and Privacy :bar_chart:

:::success
**Principle**

- Algorithmic systems need to be designed with a view to acting with (moral) integrity. 
- Feel like there are a lot of principles and frameworks for this:
- Open as possible, closed as necessary
- FAIR data principles
- Appropraiate consent, informed consent, dynamic consent 
- Data gaps, collection, sources, production, storage, management, minimisation, sharing
- Domain specific guidelines
- Legislation
- Diversity of definitions across cultures and regions.
