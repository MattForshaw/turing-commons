| Information about training algorithms, parameters, fairness constraints, or other applied approaches, and features | *Information about individual models + how they relate/impact each other to achieve the end goal* |
|Paper or other resource for more information           |    User guide, full detail documentation, technical specification, source code repository           | 
| Citation details| Model authors, team
| License | Joint private license
| Where to send questions or comments about the model| XXXX@gmail.com
