<p>In the previous section, we looked at the reflect, act, and justify procedure, which was used to help develop and draw together the constitutive elements of an assurance case.
To summarise, <a class="reference internal" href="#reflect-act-justify"><span class="std std-ref">A schematic that depicts the reflect, act and justify process.</span></a> presents a simple illustration of the above process with reference to the three core elements.</p>

<p>But how do you know which <strong>goals</strong> are relevant for specific projects?
How do you use these goals to identify salient <strong>properties</strong>?
And, how do you evaluate and determine if you have sufficient <strong>evidence</strong> to support your claims and overall case?</p>
<p>By now, you will probably find it unsurprising to hear that a reflective, inclusive, and socially embedded process of stakeholder engagement is key.
Consider again the original definition of responsible research and innovation presented in <a class="reference internal" href="../chapter2/responsibility.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">Chapter 2</span></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Responsible Research and Innovation is a transparent, interactive process by which societal actors and innovators become mutually responsive to each other with a view on the (ethical) acceptability, sustainability and societal desirability of the innovation process and its marketable products (in order to allow a proper embedding of scientific and technological advances in our society).” <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bibliography.html#id72">Von Schomberg, 2011</a>]</span></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>But even though stakeholder engagement is necessary, a project team still need a springboard to help facilitate communication and deliberation with stakeholders.
That is, they need a starting point, grounded in an informed understanding of the potential harms that can arise from the misuse of data science and AI.
This is why we introduced the SAFE-D principles in <a class="reference internal" href="../chapter3/responsible_ds.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">Chapter 3</span></a>.
These principles were not plucked from thin air.
They are rooted in and interconnected with wide-ranging and multi-disciplinary methods of enquiry that explore such social and ethical harms and benefits (e.g., moral philosophy, human rights law, and science and technology studies), and are also enhanced through diverse modes of knowledge production (e.g., citizen science, investigative journalism, quality assurance, and activism).</p>
<p>As such, the SAFE-D principles represent significant normative goals and valuable starting points for a process of reflection, action and justification.
While it is not possible to show how they can be operationalised in every possible data science or AI project, it is possible to expand upon the goals by discussing some of their core attributes.</p>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Safety</p></td>
<td><p>Safety is core to sustainability but goes beyond the mere operational safety of the system. It also includes an understanding of the long-term use context and impact of the system, and the resources needed to ensure the system continues to operate safely over time within its environment (i.e. is sustainable). For instance, safety may depend upon sufficient change monitoring processes that establish whether there has been any substantive drift in the underlying data distributions or social operating environment. Or, it could also involve engaging and involving users and stakeholders in the design and assessment of AI systems that could impact their human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Security</p></td>
<td><p>Security encompasses the protection of several operational dimensions of an AI system when confronted with possible adversarial attack. A secure system is capable of maintaining the integrity of its constitutive information. This includes protecting its architecture from the unauthorised modification or damage of any of its component parts. A secure system also remains continuously functional and accessible to its authorised users and keeps confidential and private information secure even under hostile or adversarial conditions.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Robustness</p></td>
<td><p>The objective of robustness can be thought of as the goal that an AI system functions reliably and accurately under harsh or uncertain conditions. These conditions may include adversarial intervention, implementer error, or skewed goal-execution by an automated learner (in reinforcement learning applications). The measure of robustness is, therefore, the strength of a system’s functional integrity and the soundness of its operation in response to difficult conditions, adversarial attacks, perturbations, data poisoning, or undesirable reinforcement learning behaviour.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Reliability</p></td>
<td><p>The objective of reliability is that an AI system behaves exactly as its designers intended and anticipated. A reliable system adheres to the specifications it was programmed to carry out. Reliability is therefore a measure of consistency and can establish confidence in the safety of a system based upon the dependability with which it conforms to its intended functionality.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Accuracy and Performance</p></td>
<td><p>The accuracy of a model is the proportion of examples for which it generates a correct output. This performance measure is also sometimes characterised conversely as an error rate or the fraction of cases for which the model produces an incorrect output. Specifying a reasonable performance level for the system may also require refining or exchanging the measure of accuracy. For instance, if certain errors are more significant or costly than others, a metric for total cost can be integrated into the model so that the cost of one class of errors can be weighed against that of another.</p></td>

<p>The above goals and corresponding list of attributes may seem daunting.
However, they do not represent a checklist that all research and innovation projects must provide documentation for (e.g. an assurance case).
Instead, it is best to think of them as deliberative prompts—a reflect-list rather than a checklist.
If, in discussion as a team and in conjunction with stakeholders, it is determined that certain attributes are irrelevant to the project for justifiable reasons, then no activities may be necessary.
A principle of proportionality can certianly be adopted here as a <em>meta-principle</em> of sorts, helping direct project governance decisions.</p>
<p>But, if a goal and attribute is deemed important, then the next step is to consider what system or project properties need to be established, and what evidence must be gathered and documented, in order to demonstrate that the top-level goal (and corresponding attributes) have been obtained.</p>
<p>Here, unfortunately, we can only provide some illustrative examples that link a goal and attribute with a possible system or property claim, and also suggest where in the project lifecycle such an activity would be undertaken. As these are examples, no evidential artefact is provided.</p>
