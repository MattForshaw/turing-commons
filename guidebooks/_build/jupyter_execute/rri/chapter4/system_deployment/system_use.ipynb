    "The Ancient Greek philosopher, Heraclitus believed that all things are in a constant state of change or *flux*â€”a doctrine made famous by the following statement:\n",

    "Metaphysics aside, it is certainly true that our world is dynamic and that many things change over time.\n",
    "As a result of this, and depending on the context of deployment, the performance of a model that aims to predict, classify, or recommend, is likely to degrade as the populations or objects it represents change or evolve.\n",
    "This process of *model drift* can be said to occur when there is increasing variation between how representative the training dataset was at the time of development and how representative it is at later stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many context- and domain-specific causes of model drift.\n",
    "However, we can consider two main types.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the one hand, drift can occur when the statistical properties of an input variable change (i.e. there is a shift in the underlying data distribution). For example, perhaps house prices start increasing and a model becomes more and more inaccurate at predicting them.[^selection] \n",
    "\n",
    "The following offers a graphical representation of this problem, with a distributional shift between two different points in time (T=1, T=2).\n",
    "\n",
    "[^selection]: Sometimes this type of drift may not be because of any underlying change in the properties of the relevant variable, but because of issues with the original data collection in the first place (e.g. selection bias)."
