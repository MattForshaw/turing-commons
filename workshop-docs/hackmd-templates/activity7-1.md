## Predicting Risk of Reoffending

You are a project team responsible for developing a predictive risk assessment tool that can support sentencing decisions by judges in criminal courts. The tool will take data about a defendant and feed this into an algorithm that predicts a *risk score*, between 1 and 5 that is presented to the judge alongside additional case evidence (e.g., witness testimony). This score will represent the likelihood of reoffending, and, therefore, inform the sentencing decision made by the judge. For those that are discharged, the system will also receive feedback about whether the defendant goes on to reoffend.
